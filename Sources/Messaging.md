# KiBoard Messaging

The internal `message` function is used to simplify the code pertaining to dispatching messages from `KiBoard` instances to their associated messagers.
`message` must be called with a `KiBoard` instance as its `this` value.

	sendMessage = ( data = { } ) ->
		throw new TypeError "KiBoard messages can only be sent from a KiBoard instance." unless @ instanceof KiBoard
		header = sender: "https://kite.KIBI.network/KiBoard/"
		header[key] = value for key in [
			"id"
			"layout"
			"charset"
			"mode"
			"modifiers"
			"state"
		] when value = @[key] # Only nonempty values are sent
		@messager? { ...header, ...data }
